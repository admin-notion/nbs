                    <p className="pb-4 md:w-3/4 text-lg"> Cloud services provide more flexibility and scalability by granting healthcare businesses remote access to data and applications. Additionally, they provide improved security and backup features, protecting private patient information.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4 md:w-3/4 text-lg" > Healthcare needs cybersecurity solutions because of its growing reliance on technology. The confidentiality and integrity of patient data are maintained by these systems, which guard against data breaches and cyberattacks.</p>
